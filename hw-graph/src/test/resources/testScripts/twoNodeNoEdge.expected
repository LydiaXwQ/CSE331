# Tests for a graph with two nodes and no edges.
# Test that a graph can be created, two nodes can be added, and the
# nodes and edges can be printed out.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to graph 1
added node n2 to graph 1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1 and n2
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are:
the children of n2 in graph1 are:
