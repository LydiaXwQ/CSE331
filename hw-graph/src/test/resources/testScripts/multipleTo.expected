# Tests for a graph with 3 node and 2 edge (point the same node).
# Test that a graph can be created, 3 node and 2 edges can be added, and the
# nodes and edges can be printed out.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph 1
added node n2 to graph 1
added node n3 to graph 1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1 and n2
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n3(e1)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n3(e2)
