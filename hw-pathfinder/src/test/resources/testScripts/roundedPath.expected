# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path cost is different before and after rounding.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph

added edge 3.290 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 4.554 from B to C in simpleGraph

path from A to C:
A to B with weight 3.290
B to C with weight 4.554
total cost: 7.844
