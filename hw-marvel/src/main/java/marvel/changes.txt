Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel,
and why you made those changes.

I remove my check of "if the pass-in edge already exist in the graph, throws exception"
in my addEdge method. I did this for two reasons. First, I realize that I don't need this check,
because my edge container is a set, and set won't have duplicated element which means my edge set
won't include a duplicate edge in it, even though the edge passing in was duplicate. Second, for the client,
it will be too hard to find out which edge they put in is duplicated and go back to change it if the
dataset is very large.

Accordingly, I also change the Junit test for my addEdge method to ensure there won't be duplicate
edge exist in my graph: I input two identical edge, but my final graph only contains one of them.
