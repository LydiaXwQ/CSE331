# Tests for a graph with 1 node and 1 edge (point to itself).
# Test that a graph can be created, 1 node and 1 self edge can be added, and the
# nodes and edges can be printed out.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1)
